-- 1️⃣ Create DEPARTMENT table FIRST
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT (
    DNO INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Dname VARCHAR(20),
    Mgrstartdate INT,
    MgrSSN INT
);

-- 2️⃣ Insert department data
INSERT INTO DEPARTMENT VALUES (1, 'HR', 2020, 101);
INSERT INTO DEPARTMENT VALUES (2, 'Finance', 2021, 102);
INSERT INTO DEPARTMENT VALUES (3, 'IT', 2019, 103);
INSERT INTO DEPARTMENT VALUES (4, 'Marketing', 2022, 104);

-- 3️⃣ Create employee2 table AFTER department
CREATE TABLE employee2 (
    Fname VARCHAR(20),
    LName VARCHAR(20),
    SSN INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Address VARCHAR(20),
    sex CHAR(1),
    salary INT,
    superSSN INT,
    DNO INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DNO) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT(DNO)
);

-- 4️⃣ Insert employee data
INSERT INTO employee2 
(Fname, LName, SSN, Address, sex, salary, superSSN, DNO)
VALUES 
('Amit', 'Shrestha', 115, 'Chitwan', 'M', 48000, 113, 4);

('Nita', 'Sharma', 120, 'Biratnagar', 'F', 52000, 118, 5);

-- 5️⃣ Query with corrected department name (Marketing instead of research)
SELECT E.Fname, E.LName,
E.salary * 1.10 AS increased_salary
FROM employee2 E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D 
ON E.DNO = D.DNO
WHERE D.Dname = 'Marketing';

-- 6️⃣ Aggregate query (Corrected department name)
SELECT SUM(E.salary) AS total_salary,
       MAX(E.salary) AS max_salary,
       MIN(E.salary) AS min_salary,
       AVG(E.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employee2 E
JOIN DEPARTMENT D 
ON E.DNO = D.DNO
WHERE D.Dname = 'HR';

-- 7️⃣ Select employees by existing department
SELECT Fname, LName 
FROM employee2
WHERE DNO = 4;
SELECT Fname,Lname from employee2 employees
WHERE exists(SELECT 1 FROM employee2 employees
where e.DNO=4 and E.SSN=e.SSN);

SELECT D.DNO, 
       D.Dname, 
       COUNT(E.SSN) AS total_employees
FROM DEPARTMENT D
JOIN employee2 E
ON D.DNO = E.DNO
GROUP BY D.DNO, D.Dname
HAVING COUNT(E.SSN) >= 2;
